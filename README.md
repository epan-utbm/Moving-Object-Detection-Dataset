# Moving Object Detection dataset for Urban Driving Scenes

A new dataset for moving object detection is developed that covers all the dynamic objects like, all types of vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, train, buses, motorcyclists, etc. Existing available datasets for moving object detection only focused on vehicles with car, truck, and van object categories.

The more accurate and a practical way of detecting moving object in vision tasks is by understanding the motion across two sequential images. We used several sequences from KITTI-raw and EU long-term datasets to prepare a total of 10059 binary mask images (having static/moving objects) with corresponding annotated binary mask labels (having moving objects only). Each binary mask label for moving objects is build from corresponding sequence pair images.
